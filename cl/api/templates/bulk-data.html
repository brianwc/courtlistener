        <h2 id="about">Bulk Data</h2>
        <p>For hackers, legal analysts and anybody else that might want them, we provide bulk files containing all of our data. Several types of files are available as listed below, but in general the files that are available correspond to the major types of data we have in our database.
        </p>


        <h3 id="bulk-data">Bulk Data Files</h3>
        <p>Bulk data is handled in one of two ways. For data types where it makes sense, JSON files are made for every object, and they are then placed in compressed tar.gz files by jurisdiction. These are then made available, and an additional file, all.tar, is produced containing all of the compressed jurisdictional files.
        </p>
        <p>For some data types, jurisdictional archives don't make sense. So instead, we produce the JSON files then gather then up into a single all.tar.gz file.
        </p>
        <p>You will also find <code>info.json</code> files tucked into the archives. These describe the last time the bulk data was created and how long it took to generate (in seconds).
        </p>

        <p>Some examples:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>All opinions from the First Circuit of Appeals (ca1):
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>
                        <a href="/api/bulk-data/opinions/ca1.tar.gz">{% get_full_host %}/api/bulk-data/<strong>opinions</strong>/<strong>ca1</strong>.tar.gz</a>
                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>All audio files (oral arguments) from the Third Circuit of Appeals (ca3):
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>
                        <a href="/api/bulk-data/audio/ca3.tar.gz">https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-data/<strong>audio</strong>/<strong>ca3</strong>.tar.gz</a>
                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>All opinions from all jurisdictions (note this is a .tar file, not a .tar.gz file):</dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>
                        <a href="/api/bulk-data/opinions/all.tar">{% get_full_host %}api/bulk-data/<strong>opinions</strong>/<strong>all</strong>.tar</a>
                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>All dockets from all jurisdictions:</dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>
                        <a href="/api/bulk-data/dockets/all.tar">{% get_full_host %}/api/bulk-data/<strong>dockets</strong>/<strong>all</strong>.tar</a>
                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>All court data:</dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>
                        <a href="/api/bulk-data/courts/all.tar.gz">https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-data/<strong>jurisdiction</strong>/<strong>all</strong>.tar</a>
                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Note how <code>courts</code> is a tar.gz file and <code>dockets</code> provides a tar file. This is because it does not make sense to break up the court data by jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>You can see all the types of data available at <a href="/api/bulk-data/">the root of the bulk data</a>.
        <p>These files are always generated using the latest version of the <a href="{% url "rest_docs" %}">REST API</a> and follow the schemas described there. The files inside the tar archives have names corresponding to the ID of each item, and are formatted as JSON. If you wish to see a sample file, we advise selecting a small or secretive jurisdiction (such as the FISA court) and using that to get an idea of what the bulk files contain.
        </p>
        <p>A list of all current jurisdictions is on the right and we regularly
            add new jurisdictions. To monitor for new jurisdictions, you may
            want to look at the <a href="{% url "rest_docs" %}#jurisdiction-endpoint">Jurisdiction endpoint</a> of the REST API.
        </p>


        <h3 id="citation-data">Citation Bulk Data File</h3>
        <p>
            A new file that is available in the latest updates to our bulk
            data system is a CSV that contains all of the citation
            relationships between opinions in our database. This file currently
            has more than fourteen million lines, one per citation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This file can be obtained in a similar manner to the core data
            types, by downloading the file that's available at:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>
                <a href="/api/bulk-data/citations/all.csv.gz">{% get_full_host %}/api/bulk-data/citations/all.csv.gz</a>
            </code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The format of the file is two columns. The first column is the <code>opinion</code> that cites the second. This was simplified when v3 of the API was released.
        </p>


        <h3 id="citegeist">The CiteGeist Bulk Data File</h3>
        <p>
            On the 15th of each month, we re-generate the <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2013/11/12/courtlistener-improves-search-results-thanks-to-volunteer-contributor/">CiteGeist scores</a> for the entire collection. Since a single new citation can have a ripple effect across the entire citation network, we store these values in a flat file rather than in our database. This saves us from having to update millions of records every month.
        </p>
        <p>This file can be obtained with:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl -O {% get_full_host %}{% url "pagerank_file" %}</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>When inspecting this file, you will find two columns of data. The
            first column corresponds to the ID numbers of the items in our
            opinion database, and the second value corresponds to the CiteGeist
            score for that item.
        </p>


        <h3>Generation Times</h3>
        <p>As can be seen on the public <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=michaeljaylissner.com_fvcq09gchprghkghqa69be5hl0@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles">CourtListener maintenance calendar</a>, bulk data files are regenerated on the last day of every month beginning at 3AM PST. Generation can take many hours, but in general is expected to conclude before the 1st of each month. On the last day of the month, we do not guarantee that you will get either the new or old archives, as archives are updated in place as their generation completes. You can verify the generation time using the <code>info.json</code> files.
        </p>


        <h3>Donations</h3>
        <p><a href="http://freelawproject.org">Free Law Project</a> has been providing bulk data for many years but is opposed to charging for public domain data. However, if you find these files valuable to your work, we ask that you seriously consider how much they might cost otherwise and consider making a <a href="{% url "donate" %}?referrer=bulk-data">donation</a> in a similar amount. Free Law Project is a federally-recognized 501(c)(3) public charity and a California non-profit public benefit corporation. We rely on your support to survive. Please donate or this resource <em>will</em> go away.
        </p>



        <h3>Adding Features and Fixing Bugs</h3>
        <p>Like all Free Law Project initiatives, CourtListener is an open source project. If you are a developer and you notice bugs or missing features, we enthusiastically welcome your contributions <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener">on Github</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there are always more bugs than time.</p>



        <h3>Obsoleted Bulk Data APIs</h3>
        <p>In the past, bulk data files were available by day, month, or year
            for every jurisdiction, and a single file was available containing
            all data. Without community objection, these APIs <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener/issues/285">were sunsetted</a>
            in the fall of 2014.
