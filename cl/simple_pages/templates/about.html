        <h2 id="the-site">About</h2>

        <p>Started in 2010, CourtListener is a core project of the <a
                href="http://freelawproject.org/">Free Law Project</a>, a
            federally-recognized 501(c)(3) public charity and a
            California non-profit public benefit corporation. Free Law
            Project seeks to provide free access to primary legal materials,
            develop legal research tools, and support academic research on
            legal corpora. CourtListener embodies all of these efforts, as the
            primary free repository of all the court opinions we have
            collected, as the platform on which we deploy legal research tools,
            and as the source of bulk downloads that enable academic
            researchers to study our collection.
        </p>

        <p>We collect legal opinions from court websites and from data
            donations, and are aiming to have the best, most complete data on
            the open Web within the next couple years. We are slowly expanding
            to provide search and awareness tools for as many state courts as
            possible, and we already have tools for all of the Federal Appeals
            Courts. For more details on which jurisdictions we support see our
            <a href="{% url "coverage" %}">coverage page</a>. If you're able to help us
            acquire more cases, please <a href="{% url "contact" %}">get in touch</a>.
