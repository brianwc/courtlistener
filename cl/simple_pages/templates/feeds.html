        <p>We have a number of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">feeds</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasts</a> so
            that you can easily stay up to date with the latest content from
            the courts without having to visit any website each day.</p>
        <p>To subscribe to these feeds you will need an app or other program
            that can regularly check the feed for new content. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">Numerous
            options</a> for this are available for almost any device.</p>
        <p>The feeds and podcasts we provide are powered by <a
                href="https://github.com/freelawproject/juriscraper/">Juriscraper</a>.
            We are able to add and support more feeds as we receive <a
                    href="{% url "donate" %}?referrer=feeds">support</a> from you.</p>

                <h3 id="search-feeds">Search Feeds</h3>
                <p>As you use the search engine, a feed or podcast is generated for
                    every search that you do. For opinions, tou can subscribe to these
                    feeds using a URL like:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>https://www.courtlistener.com/feed/search/?q=your-query</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>For oral arguments, a podcast is created at:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>https://www.courtlistener.com/podcast/search/?q=your-query</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The best way to create these feeds is to do your search like you
                    always do, and then use the subscribe button in your browser to
                    or the RSS icon (<i class="gray fa fa-rss"></i>) on the
                    search results page to identify the correct link.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 id="cited-by-feeds">Feeds for New Citations</h3>
                <p>As we add items to our collection, we regularly discover new
                    citations to existing opinions. If you wish to stay up to date
                    with these new citations, you can do so using a search feed.
                </p>
                <p>Citation feeds thus take the form:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>https://www.courtlistener.com/feed/search/?q=cites:({opinion_id})</code>
                </blockquote>
                <p>As with search feeds, the easiest way to create these is to
                    do a search and then click the subscribe button in your
                    browser or the RSS icon (<i class="gray fa fa-rss"></i>) on the search results page.
                </p>
                <p>By using a search query for this feed, we are also able to
                    set up <a href="{% url "faq" %}#explain-alerts">alerts</a>, sending
                    you an email whenever there is a new opinion citing one you
                    follow.
                </p>
